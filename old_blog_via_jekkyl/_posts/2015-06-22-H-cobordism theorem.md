**H-Cobordism Theorem.**
Suppose $W^{n+1}$ is a smooth compact oriented cobordism between $V^n_1$ and $V^n_2$. If

* $n \ge 5$

* $\pi_1(W^{n+1})=\pi_1(V_1^{n})=\pi_1(V_2^{n})=1$

* $H_*(W,V_1)=0$ (i.e. our cobordism is h-cobordism, i.e. $V_i \hookrightarrow W$ is homotopy equivalence)

then $W^{n+1}$ is a product cobordism.

###1. Smooth structure gives us handle decomposition. 

**Morse functions => handle decomposition.**

**Reordering handles.**

**Can assume that there is only one 0 and one n handle (i.e. cobordism is connected).**

###2. Cellular homology structure of $(W,V)$ coming from handle decomposition.

###3. Key lemma: canceling 2 handles of subsequent indices.

###5. Eliminating handles of index $2\le k \le n-2$.

###6. Eliminating handles of index $1$ and $n-1$.
